# <center>Why Am I Writing This?</center>

Well I would like to say its for the benefit of mankind but that would be a lie. Its pretty much for the benefit of me be it learning new technologies and keeping a record, discussing fantasy football, or business talk.

I wanted to start using a static site generator and become more proficient in markdown as well. So I picked Hugo to start using for a static site generaor since GOlang is the new hotness for me. If anyone has a good Hugo tips and tricks you can go ahead and email me at intelwalk@gmail.com.
